    <p>
      These gingerbread cookies are the kind of nostalgic treat that brings warmth to any cold day.
      They're everything a good cookie should be: lightly crisp on the edges, soft in the middle, and full
      of the deep, spicy notes of molasses, cinnamon, ginger, and cloves. Whether you're baking them for a
      festive gathering, decorating them with kids, or simply making a batch to snack on throughout the week,
      this recipe delivers consistent results. The key to acing these cookies is in the chilling and rolling —
      don’t rush those steps. Chilled dough means clean cookie cutter shapes and even baking, while rolling to
      just the right thickness keeps texture perfect.

      <h3>Tips for Success</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Chill the dough well — this helps clean cuts and keeps cookies from spreading.</li>

        <li>For soft cookies, bake 7–8 minutes; for crisp ones, bake closer to 10 minutes.</li>
