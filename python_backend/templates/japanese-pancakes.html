    <p>
      Japanese fluffy pancakes aren't your typical breakfast stack. They're airy, souffle-like,
      and a little technical, but that's part of what makes them satisfying to master.  
      If you've ever wondered how to get that dramatic rise and custard-soft texture,
      the secret is in gentle mixing, low heat, and a little patience.
    </p>
    <p>
      These pancakes take time, but they reward you with something closer to a plated dessert
      than a diner breakfast. Don't rush it—heat too high or batter too thin,
      and you'll end up with collapsed domes or dry insides.
      Follow the method carefully and you'll get jiggly, cloud-like pancakes
      with golden edges and a delicately sweet flavor.

      <h3>Step-by-Step Method</h3>

      <p><strong>Step 1: Make the Pancake Batter</strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li>In a bowl, mix yogurt, milk, egg, vanilla, melted butter.</li>
        <li>In another bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, sugar.</li>
        <li>Combine wet and dry ingredients. Stir until just smooth. Don’t overmix.</li>
        <li>Batter should be thick and scoopable. Add 1 tsp milk if too thick.</li>
      </ol>

      <p><strong>Step 2: Cook Fluffy Pancakes</strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li>Heat a nonstick pan on low heat and lightly butter it.</li>
        <li>Use metal ring molds (or foil ones). Grease inside of rings.</li>
        <li>Scoop batter into molds (¾ full). Cover with lid.</li>
        <li>Cook for 6–7 mins on low heat until bubbles form and sides are set.</li>
        <li>Flip gently with spatula and tongs. Cook other side 4–5 mins.</li>
        <li>Remove molds carefully. Let pancakes cook uncovered for 1 more minute.</li>
      </ol>

      <p><strong>Step 3: Make Strawberry Compote</strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li>In a small pan, add strawberries, sugar, lemon juice.</li>
        <li>Cook on medium heat for 5–7 mins until soft and syrupy.</li>
        <li>Let cool slightly — warm and spoonable is perfect.</li>
      </ol>

      <p><strong>Step 4: Make Vanilla Cream</strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li>Whip cold cream, vanilla, and powdered sugar until soft peaks form.</li>
        <li>Keep chilled until ready to serve with pancakes.</li>
      </ol>
