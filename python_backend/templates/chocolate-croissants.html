      Chocolate croissants — or *pain au chocolat* — aren't just pastries, they're a weekend ritual, a buttery reward 
      wrapped in golden layers. Perfecting them takes patience, but the payoff is worth every fold and chill. The dough 
      should feel cool and smooth, the butter should stay firm, and the lamination process is where the magic happens. 
      When baked right, you get that audible flake with each bite, revealing a soft center and a ribbon of dark chocolate 
      that makes each bite melt in your mouth. Don't be discouraged by the steps — it’s about rhythm, not perfection.

      <h3>Step-by-Step Instructions</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Make the Dough (Night Before):</strong> Mix flour, sugar, yeast, and salt. Add cold milk and melted butter. Knead until smooth (5–6 mins). Flatten, wrap, and chill overnight or at least 2 hours.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare Butter Block:</strong> Pound cold butter between parchment sheets into a 6x6 inch (15x15 cm) square. Chill until firm but pliable.</li>
        <li><strong>Laminate:</strong> Roll dough into a 12x6 inch (30x15 cm) rectangle. Place butter in the center and fold like a letter. Roll out, fold again — repeat for 3 total folds, chilling 30 mins between. Rest 1 hour after final fold.</li>
        <li><strong>Shape:</strong> Roll dough into 8x20 inch rectangle. Cut into 4x3 inch rectangles. Place chocolate in center, fold, and roll into logs.</li>
        <li><strong>Proof:</strong> Place on tray, cover lightly, and let rise for 1.5–2 hours in a warm spot until puffed and jiggly.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Preheat oven to 200°C (390°F). Brush with egg wash. Bake for 18–22 minutes until golden brown.</li>
      </ol>

    <section class="tips">
      <h3>Tips for Success</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Use European-style butter:</strong> Higher fat means flakier pastry and better flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Keep dough cold:</strong> Prevents butter from melting too early.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t rush the proofing:</strong> Fully proofed croissants will have better rise and airiness.</li>
        <li><strong>Chocolate batons:</strong> Ideal for even chocolate distribution, but chopped bar also works.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="add-ons">

        <li>Dust with powdered sugar before serving.</li>
