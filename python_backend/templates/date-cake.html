      A good date cake is more than just a sweet treat—it's the kind of dessert that feels 
      like a quiet win. With its deep, caramel-like flavor from the softened dates, a soft 
      crumb from the yogurt and whole wheat flour, and a satisfying crunch from the walnuts, 
      this cake finds the right balance between indulgent and nourishing. Whether you’re 
      baking for guests or keeping it all to yourself for the week ahead, nailing this cake 
      means paying attention to a few simple details: don’t skip soaking the dates, mix the 
      wet and dry ingredients with care, and don’t overbake it. The result? A moist, golden 
      loaf that slices beautifully and doesn’t even need frosting—though a light yogurt glaze 
      takes it to another level if you’re feeling extra. And if you're looking for a vegan, 
      gluten-free, or healthier version of this exact recipe, our built-in AI baking assistant 
      is here to help. It’ll guide you through ingredient swaps that actually work—not just 
      guesses—so you can enjoy this cake however you like it.
