    <p>
      Olive oil focaccia is one of those humble yet magical bakes that delivers far more than the sum of its parts. 
      With its crisp golden crust, airy crumb, and rich olive oil flavor, it’s a bread that feels both rustic and refined. 
      Whether served warm with dips, layered into a sandwich, or enjoyed as is, it never fails to impress. 
      The key to nailing focaccia lies in letting the dough ferment slowly overnight — that long rest builds the signature 
      bubbles and softness. Don’t skimp on the olive oil either; it’s not just for taste but also helps develop the 
      beautiful crust and prevents sticking. Our AI chatbot is also here to help if you’re looking for substitutions — 
      whether you're vegan, gluten-free, or just need to work with what’s in your pantry. Ask it for a healthy swap or 
      alternative and it'll guide you instantly.

      <h3>Dough Instructions</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Mix the Dough:</strong> In a large bowl, stir together flour, salt, sugar, and yeast. Add warm water and olive oil. Mix into a sticky dough (no kneading needed).</li>
        <li><strong>First Rise (Bulk):</strong> Cover and let rise at room temp for 8–12 hours (overnight is great). Dough should triple and look bubbly.</li>
        <li><strong>Pan & Proof:</strong> Generously oil a 9x13" pan (2–3 tbsp). Pour in the jiggly dough and gently stretch it to fit. Let rise 2–4 hours until very puffy.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Topping & Baking</h3>
      <ol start="4">
        <li><strong>Dimple & Top:</strong> Preheat oven to 220°C / 425°F. Drizzle 2–3 tbsp olive oil over dough. Use oiled fingers to dimple deeply. Add flaky salt, rosemary, and any toppings.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Bake 22–28 mins until golden on top and crisp underneath. Cool 10–15 minutes before slicing.</li>
