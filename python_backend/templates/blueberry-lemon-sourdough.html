    <p>
      The Blueberry Lemon Sourdough Boule is a unique twist on traditional sourdough, combining the tang of lemon zest
      with the juicy sweetness of blueberries. It's not just a loaf; it's a celebration of contrasts—crisp crust meets
      tender crumb, fruity brightness meets earthy fermentation. It might seem like a bakery-level challenge, but with
      careful attention to temperature and fermentation timing, even a home baker can achieve that signature open crumb
      and vibrant flavor.

    <p>
      Make sure your sourdough starter is active and bubbly before you start. Don’t rush the cold proof—this step develops
      the texture and flavor that make this boule so memorable. If your dough feels tricky to handle after adding berries,
      use wet hands and a gentle touch to keep from tearing the gluten structure. And for those with dietary needs, we’ve
      got you covered—our built-in AI chatbot is ready to offer gluten-free, vegan, or health-conscious substitutions for
      any ingredient in this recipe. Just ask, and it will guide you.
