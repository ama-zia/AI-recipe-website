    <p>
      Brioche is one of those magical baked goods that sits at the intersection of bread and dessert. 
      It's rich with butter and eggs, lightly sweet, and impossibly soft inside with a golden crust 
      that feels like something you’d only get at a French bakery. If you’ve ever hesitated to bake 
      bread from scratch, let this be your gateway. It’s a forgiving dough if you take your time, 
      and the result is worth every minute. The key to acing this recipe lies in the kneading — don’t 
      rush it. Let the dough pull together fully before adding the butter, and don’t skip the cold 
      overnight fermentation step; it deepens the flavor and improves the texture. Use a kitchen scale 
      for best accuracy and don’t be afraid of sticky dough — it’s meant to be that way.

      gluten-free, or healthier version of this brioche. Whether you want to substitute the eggs, 
      the dairy, or reduce the sugar, our chatbot will suggest smart swaps tailored to your needs 
      without compromising the quality of your bake.
